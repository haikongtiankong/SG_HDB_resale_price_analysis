# SG_HDB_resale_price_analysis
## Problem Statement
Recent years, there has been high volatility in the housing sales price in Singapore and due to rising cost and 
pandemics, we are seeing a lot of variation in the housing market. Many young married couples have not 
been able to get themselves more financially ready in starting a family. We hope to help them by providing 
in-depth analysis to future housing prices so that they can better estimate their purchasing power.
## Proposed Data Collection Technique
Our technique of data collection is to access government published data and merge them into one big data 
warehouse for analysis. We have chosen the chosen the HDB (Housing and Development Board) Price 
index from the openly available data from Singapore government website data.gov.sg/infrastructure. The 
team approach is to analyse the dataset readily available and include independent variables from external 
datasets to predict prices of housing annually within the year range from 2009 to 2022. The external data 
likes Consumer price indexes across the year range which we have decided to use as part of our data 
prediction variable. Our goal is to predict future selling prices of HDB houses in Singapore base on the 
house location, flat type, floor, and economic situation.
We have also explored different data found in the government website; examples of building material cost 
are one of them. Searching extensively within the data domain to acquire relevant information which we 
think will be useful. 
Below table shows the list of data sets which we have acquired and merged.

Resale Flat Prices based on approval 2000 Feb to 2012 | Consumer price index at expenditure group level 2019 as base year monthly
Resale flat prices based on registration date from Mar2012 to dec 2014 | Private residential property rental index base quarter 2009 Q1-100 quarterly
