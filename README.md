## Problem Statement
Recent years, there has been high volatility in the housing sales price in Singapore and due to rising cost and 
pandemics, we are seeing a lot of variation in the housing market. Many young married couples have not 
been able to get themselves more financially ready in starting a family. We hope to help them by providing 
in-depth analysis to future housing prices so that they can better estimate their purchasing power.
